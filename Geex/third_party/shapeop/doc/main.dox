\section introduction_sec Introduction

This library introduces a unified optimization framework for static and dynamic geometry processing based on \cite Bouaziz2012 and \cite Bouaziz2014. This library comes from an effort to make research reproducible and to transfer knowledge and technology. 


This project is jointly developed by the following contributors:

- ShapeOp Solver: \a Sofien \a Bouaziz 

- Rhino/Kangaroo: \a Daniel \a Piker, \a Bailin \a Deng, \a Anders \a Holden \a Deleuran

- Javascript/WebGL: \a Johan \a Berdat

Install CMake (http://www.cmake.org) and Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) using your favorite package manager. Then in the main repository type:

 - mkdir build
 - cd build
 - cmake ..
 - make

After building the library, you can generate the documentation by typing:

 - cd doc
 - doxygen DoxyShapeOp

To generate the documentation first install Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/). You will also need to have Bibtex and Perl available to get the bibliography compiled.

### Compilation under Windows.

Download and install CMake (http://www.cmake.org) and Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).
 
 - run the cmake executable
 - define where the Eigen repository is located
 - create a visual studio solution
 - open the visual studio solution and compile.

### More details on the different compilation options.

For more details on the different compilation options see \ref doc_libshapeop.
